      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        The idea for Modest Layers was born out of a desire to create fashionable clothing that reflects values and individuality. 
        We noticed a lack of options that balanced modesty with contemporary design, and decided to fill that gap with thoughtfully 
        curated pieces for every occasion.
      </p>
